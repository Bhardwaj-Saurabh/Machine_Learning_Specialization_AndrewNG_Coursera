The slope is consistent during the linear portion and then changes abruptly at transition points. At transition points, a new linear function is added which, when added to the existing function, will produce the new slope. The new function is added at transition point but does not contribute to the output prior to that point. The non-linear activation function is responsible for disabling the input prior to and sometimes after the transition points. The following exercise provides a more tangible example."
